Additionally, you can adjust the lighting to create a more dramatic and focused look on the woman. This can be achieved by using the "Levels" or "Curves" tool in the photo editing software to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image. Finally, you can apply a filter or adjust the color balance to create a more visually appealing and consistent look between the source and target images.
